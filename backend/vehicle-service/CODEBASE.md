## Architecture

The Vehicle Service follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **Routes Layer**: Defines API endpoints and passes requests to controllers
2. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and delegates to services
3. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with models
4. **Model Layer**: Represents data structures and database interactions

This separation of concerns improves maintainability and testability.

## Key Components

### Models

Vehicle models define the data structure for vehicles in the system, including:
- Basic properties (id, model, type, status)
- Registration and tracking information
- Metadata for additional specifications

### Controllers

Controllers handle the HTTP layer of the application:
- `VehicleController`: Manages vehicle-related operations (CRUD)
- Error handling and response formatting
- Input validation

### Services

Services contain the core business logic:
- `VehicleService`: Implements vehicle management operations
- Data transformation and validation
- Business rules implementation

### Routes

Routes define the API endpoints:
- Vehicle CRUD operations
- Statistics and reporting endpoints
- Health check endpoints

### Middleware

Custom middleware for:
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Logging

## Testing Strategy

The codebase employs a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and component interactions
3. **Mock Data**: Standardized test fixtures in the `mocks` directory

## Database Interaction

The service uses MongoDB for data storage:
- MongoDB connection setup in the `db` directory
- Mongoose schemas for data validation
- Repository pattern to abstract database operations

## Error Handling

Centralized error handling with:
- Custom error classes
- Error middleware for consistent API responses
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Configuration

Environment-based configuration for:
- Database connections
- Service ports and hosts
- Logging levels
- Feature flags

## Development Practices

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
